## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to identify glaucoma from medical images. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist in the early detection of glaucoma, potentially preventing vision loss through timely intervention.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results and metrics
